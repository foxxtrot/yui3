Dial Widget

3.3.0

* New Beta Component
Deprecated _setLabelString, _setTooltipString, _setResetString. 
Instead, use DialObjName.set('strings',{'label':'My new label', 'resetStr';'My New Reset'});   before DialObjName.render();
One or more strings can be changed at a time.
Removed _setXYResetString. Now done through CSS. Not called by Dial.js anymore.
